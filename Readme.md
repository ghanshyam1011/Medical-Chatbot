# 🏥 Medical Chatbot using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **AI-powered Medical Question Answering Chatbot** that can answer medical questions by retrieving relevant information from a medical knowledge base (PDF documents) and generating responses using a Large Language Model (LLM).

The system follows a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture where the chatbot first retrieves relevant medical content from a vector database and then generates a contextual answer using an LLM.

This approach improves **accuracy, reliability, and factual grounding**, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.

# 📚 What I Learned from This Project

This project helped me understand many important concepts in **AI, NLP, and modern LLM systems**:

### 1️⃣ Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

How external knowledge can be combined with LLMs to produce accurate responses.

### 2️⃣ Embedding Models

How transformer models convert text into numerical vectors for semantic search.

### 3️⃣ Vector Databases

Understanding how FAISS and Pinecone store and retrieve high-dimensional embeddings efficiently.

### 4️⃣ Document Processing

Extracting and splitting large documents for better context retrieval.

### 5️⃣ Prompt Engineering

Designing prompts that guide LLMs to generate accurate and concise answers.

### 6️⃣ API Integration

Using APIs like Groq for fast LLM inference.

### 7️⃣ LangChain Pipelines

Building modular pipelines that connect multiple AI components.

# 🔬 Alternative Approaches

Instead of the current pipeline, other methods could also be used:

### Different LLMs

* GPT-4
* Claude
* Gemini
* Mistral

### Different Embedding Models

* OpenAI embeddings
* Instructor embeddings
* BGE embeddings
* Cohere embeddings

### Different Vector Databases

* Pinecone
* Weaviate
* ChromaDB
* Milvus

### Different Retrieval Strategies

* Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
* Re-ranking models
* Knowledge graphs

---

# 📈 Possible Improvements

Future enhancements that can make the chatbot more powerful:

### 🧠 Better Medical Knowledge

Use structured medical datasets like:

* PubMed
* MedQA
* MedMCQA

### 📊 Hallucination Detection

Integrate systems to detect incorrect medical responses.

### 🧑‍⚕️ Clinical Validation

Add validation layers to ensure safe responses.

### 💬 Conversational Memory

Allow multi-turn conversations.

### 🖥 Web Interface

Build a UI using:

* Streamlit
* Gradio
* React

### 🧾 Citation Support

Return answers with sources and references.

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

* The chatbot relies on the provided documents.
* Medical responses may not replace professional advice.
* Performance depends on the quality of the source documents.

---

# 🌍 Applications
